<p>Like every other city, Madrid has greater traffic during holidays, which increases the number of accidents. This essay will concentrate on how holidays affect traffic accidents
  in Madrid. The important dates that have experienced a larger number of accidents will be determined by analyzing the data for the previous five years.<p>

<p>These are the dates:</p>
<p>   - Christmas (25th Dec)</p>
<p>   - New Year's Eve and Day (31st Dec - 1st Jan)</p>
<p>   - Epiphany (5th Jan)</p>
<p>   - Summer Season Entrances and Returns: Weekends in July/August</p>

<p>In addition to these common dates, other significant dates have seen a higher number of accidents in Madrid. During the Holy Week (Semana Santa), Madrid experiences a massive
  influx of visitors, leading to more traffic and more accidents. In 2019, the Holy Week was from 14th to 20th April, and in 2020 it was from 5th to 11th April. In 2021, the
  heavy snowfall caused by Storm Filomena affected the city's traffic for several days in January. The Holy Week in 2021 was from 28th March to 3rd April.</p>

<p>In 2022, there were several significant events that led to an increase in traffic and accidents. The Madrid-Barcelona football match on 20th March saw a considerable number
  of fans traveling to the stadium. The Holy Week in 2022 was from 10th to 16th April, and the Madrid Pride Parade on 9th July also led to more traffic on the roads. The 
  Champions League final, which Real Madrid won on 29th May, also saw an influx of fans to the city.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, we can expect the same trend to continue in 2023. The Holy Week will be from 2nd to 8th April, and the Madrid-Barcelona football match is scheduled for 2nd
  March.</p>

<p>Our findings, however, after reviewing the data, are not definitive. While there are unmistakable increases in traffic accidents on certain particular days, it can be 
  difficult to tell whether these accidents were also brought on by other elements like bad weather, road work, or individual drivers.</p>
