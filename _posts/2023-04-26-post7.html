<p>Imagine driving on a busy street in Madrid, minding your own business, when suddenly, out of nowhere, a car crashes into you. You're lucky to have escaped with just a few bruises
  and scratches, but the same can't be said for the driver of the other car. You can't help but wonder - what led to this accident, and could it have been prevented?</p>

<p>That's exactly what we set out to investigate - the drivers involved in traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023. We analysed the data and came up with some surprising insights 
  that shed light on the causes and trends behind these accidents. So, buckle up, and let's take a ride through our findings.</p>

<p>Our story starts with a surprising fact - the majority of accidents in Madrid involve male drivers between the ages of 40 and 44. Our first visualization shows the number of drivers by
  age and gender, and it's clear that this group has the highest number of accidents compared to other age and gender groups.</p>

<p>So, why is this age group at higher risk of accidents? We dug deeper into the data and found that most accidents involving this at-risk group occur during the afternoon rush hour, between
  11 am 3 pm. Our second visualization shows the accidents by hour of the day for this age and gender group. This could be due to increased traffic, fatigue from work, or distractions while driving.</p>

</figure>

<p>But the time of day is not the only factor contributing to accidents. Our third visualization shows the accidents by day of the week for this age and gender group, and it's clear that accidents happen more frequently on Fridays. It's possible that the higher number of people out and about during the last day of the week, starting their weekend, 
  increased alcohol consumption, or an overall relaxation of driving safety habits could be contributing factors.</p>

<p>Now, let's take a look at the types of vehicles involved in accidents. Our fourth visualization shows the accidents by type of vehicle, and it's clear that cars are the most common type of vehicle involved in accidents, followed by motorcycles and bicycles. However, heavy vehicles such as buses and trucks have a lower number of accidents. 
  This could be due to their higher level of training and stricter safety regulations. Secondly, heavy vehicles tend to be bigger and move more slowly than other types of vehicles on the road, which may increase their visibility to other motorists and lessen the probability of collisions. In addition, large vehicles may include extra safety 
  measures including collision avoidance systems, lane departure alerts, and blind spot warning systems that can assist avoid accidents. </p>

<p>Lastly, let's talk about the victims involved in accidents. Our fifth visualization shows the accidents by type of victim, and it's clear that drivers are the most common type of victim, with the strongest shade of purple, followed by passengers, darkest blue and pedestrians, lightest blue. This highlights the importance of drivers being 
  responsible and alert on the road, as their actions can have serious consequences not only for themselves but for others as well. </p>

<p> Now focusing on alcohol and drugs, two of the most worrisome causes of driving accidents in Madrid. Two important findings from our investigation help to clarify this important matter. 
The age distribution of the drivers who tested positive for drugs or alcohol was the first thing we looked at. Our research indicates that teenage drivers between the ages of 15 and 21 are 
most prone to behave recklessly when operating a vehicle. Due to these drivers' increased risk of collisions, injuries, and even fatalities, this is a worrying development that requires addressing. </p>

    <figcaption class="caption text-muted" style="margin-bottom: 20px">Proportion of positive texts in alcohol and/or drugs drivers by age.</figcaption>
  </center>
</figure>

<p> That's not all, though. We further looked at the relationship between the time of day and the probability of testing positive for alcohol or drugs. According to our research, evening and nighttime hours 
  are the riskiest since there are more positive test results during these hours. </p>

<figure>

    <figcaption class="caption text-muted" style="margin-bottom: 20px">Correlation between time of day and number of crashed drivers testing positive for drugs and/or alcohol.</figcaption>
  </center>
</figure>

<p>These findings show the need for improved enforcement of drunk driving regulations throughout the evening and nocturnal hours, despite the fact that the majority of tests were negative for drugs and alcohol. 
  This could lower the number of traffic accidents in Madrid that are caused by drugs and alcohol. </p>

<p>But ultimately, preventing such accidents depends on each individual. We need to promote awareness among young drivers of the dangers of drunk driving and the value of making thoughtful decisions. 
  We can all contribute to making Madrid's roadways safer for everyone by being proactive. </p>

<p>So, what can we take away from this story? Well, it's clear that there are specific groups of drivers who are at higher risk of accidents. By understanding these patterns, we can take steps to prevent 
  accidents and promote safer driving habits on the road. This could include increased awareness campaigns targeting specific age and gender groups, or more targeted enforcement of traffic laws during peak hours or on certain days of the week.</p>
