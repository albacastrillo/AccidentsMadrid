<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our lives, and one area that has seen some surprising changes is traffic accidents in Madrid. By analyzing 
  a dataset of traffic accidents in the city from 2019 to 2023, we can see some fascinating trends that shed light on how the pandemic has affected road safety.</p>

<p>Let's start with the basics. From our analysis, we have a calendar plot of traffic accidents in Madrid over the past few years. The plot shows a clear drop in 
  accidents during the strict lockdown measures of 2020, as people stayed home, and roads emptied out. However, as restrictions eased in 2021 and 2022, accidents 
  began to climb again, despite ongoing social distancing measures. This suggests that there is more to road safety than simply reducing the number of cars on the road.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, we can also see some interesting patterns in the data when we look at accidents over the week and over the day. For example, weekends are a clear danger
  zone - accidents are much more likely to occur on Saturdays and Sundays than on weekdays, however during covid times, the peak in the number of accidents is experimented 
  on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>The pandemic-related changes to people's work schedules and commute habits are one explanation for why there is a spike in traffic accidents on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
  With more individuals working from home, commuters may have more flexibility with their schedules and may be more likely to work from home on Mondays and Tuesdays or 
  take longer weekends. This suggests that Wednesdays and Fridays might experience an increase in traffic flow, especially during prime travel periods, which could raise 
  the possibility of accidents. Furthermore, the pandemic has increased deliveries and online sales, especially during the week, which has increased the number of delivery 
  vans and vehicles on the roadways. These automobiles may be heavier and bigger than passenger cars, and they could be operated by less experienced drivers, which raises
  the possibility of collisions.</p>

<p>In Madrid, there are often fewer car accidents on the weekends. This is probably because fewer people are going out and spending time with others, which lowers the amount
  of traffic overall. Additionally, fewer individuals may be driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs if bars and restaurants are closed or operating at a 
  reduced capacity, which can also lower the likelihood of accidents.</p>

<p>Similarly, when taking a look at the accidents over the hours of the day, there is a clear peak in accidents around midday, suggesting that factors such as lunchtime 
  traffic and rush hour congestion are key contributors to road accidents. However, it can be clearly seen that during covid time accidents that usually occurred during those
  times are spaced in time, ranging between 13:00 and 19:00. <p>

<p>Moving on to geography, we have deployed heatmap of traffic accidents in Madrid. This map provides a visual representation of where accidents ocurred, with hotspots 
  shown in red and cooler areas shown in blue. Unsurprisingly, the busiest central districts of the city, such as Madrid Centro and Moncloa-Aravaca, are hotspots for 
  accidents. These areas are characterized by high levels of traffic, with many commuters, tourists, students and residents navigating busy streets and intersections.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at the heatmap, it can be seen that there are locations with a high concentration of accidents, which are highlighted with pins. 
  With these considerations in mind, it was decided to perform a thorough street view study in order to identify the core causes of these frightening 
  patterns of accidents. Particular areas of concern are identified to establish focused initiatives to minimise the number of accidents happening in 
  these hotspots. This proactive approach will not only make roadways safer, 
  but it will also guarantee that the city continues to be a welcome and secure place for those who live call it home.</p>

<p>But there are also some surprising outliers on the map. For example, the southern district of Puente de Vallecas stands out as a hotspot for accidents, despite being 
  relatively quiet compared to other central districts. This could be due to factors such as road layout and infrastructure, or it could be linked to socio-economic factors
  such as poverty and lack of access to safe transportation.</p>

<p>Finally, in our journey of Covid’s analysis, we analysed this plot of the sex and age of victims of traffic accidents in Madrid during the pandemic. This data shows that
  men are much more likely to be involved in accidents than women, and that men aged 35-39 are at the highest risk. Due to a multitude of variables, this trend might be 
  going, this age group may be more prone to drive recklessly, have important occupations that need them to commute during rush hour, have family obligations that necessitate
  regular driving, and utilise their cars for personal errands. These elements could make accidents more likely, especially when there is less traffic and drivers might 
  be tempted to go faster. When creating initiatives to increase road safety for all age groups during the pandemic, authorities should take these aspects into account.</p>

<p>This is a pattern that holds true across all districts of the city and suggests that targeted road safety campaigns aimed at young men could be a keyway to reduce 
  accidents in the future.</p>

<p>Overall, our analysis of traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023 highlights the complex interplay between factors such as road infrastructure, traffic volume, and 
  human behaviour. By continuing to monitor and analyse these trends, we can work towards a safer and more sustainable future for our city's roads.</p>
