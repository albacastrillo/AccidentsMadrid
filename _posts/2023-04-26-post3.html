<p>Imagine this — you're a passionate cyclist who loves to ride your bike around the beautiful city of Madrid. But you've always been a little nervous about the traffic,
  especially after hearing stories of accidents involving cyclists. You've always wondered — how common are these accidents? What are the causes? And how can they be
  prevented?</p>

<p>Welcome to our in-depth analysis and visualization of traffic accidents in Madrid by bike, covering the four-year period from 2019 to 2023. As avid cyclists and advocates
  for road safety, we were inspired to take a closer look at this important issue and explore the data in order to better understand the patterns and trends of bicycle
  accidents in the city.</p>
  
<p>Our analysis begins with a comprehensive examination of the data, which provides detailed information on the date and time of each accident, the location, the type of
  accident, and the severity of injuries sustained by the cyclist. As we start to visualize the data through graphs, charts, and maps, we begin to see patterns and trends
  emerging.</p>

<p>One of the most striking observations is the sheer number of accidents that occur each year and day, indicating that this is an issue that requires urgent attention. We
  also observe that certain areas of the city have a higher concentration of accidents than others, and that these areas tend to be ones with high traffic volumes or complex
  intersections as for example Madrid’s centre is an area that cover most traffic accidents.</p>

<p>People stay working until 19:00 and then may go hang around with their co-workers for an hour and reach back home.</p>

<p>In Spain people usually have dinner in between 20:00 and 21:00 so at this time it is usual to go out to have dinner or some drinks with your friends on a weekend.</p>

<p>On the other side, we may see that accidents happen less frequently between 5:00 and 6:00 in the morning, when many individuals leave for work or school. Beginning at six,
  when there are less than fifty accidents per day, the number of accidents starts to rise substantially, reaching maxima at nine in the morning with around 170 accidents per
  day and at four in the afternoon with about 260 accidents per day.</p>

<p>We also see that some regions of the city have a larger concentration of accidents than others, and these places typically have heavy traffic or complicated crossings, 
  such as Madrid's core, which accounts for the majority of traffic accidents. The zones and streets where the majority of accidents occur may be seen in a street perspective
  on this map.</p>

<p>Just like any other major city in the world, Madrid enters the race to become a more ecologically friendly and sustainable metropolis. Because of this, BiciMad, a company that
  rents bicycles, is available in various areas of the city. Who hasn't fantasised about riding a bike across the city on a warm afternoon? Users of BiciMad can hire bicycles 
  for a certain amount of time, renting the bikes from one station to another. That is why we are interested in this service and how the location of rental stations affects
  the quantity of bicycle accidents in the city.</p>

<p>We can see that the map shows many locations for renting bicycles, and ironically, two of those locations—Cibeles and Gran Vía with San Bernardo, the two locations on 
  the map—are also BiciMad rental locations where we have noticed an increase in bicycle accidents. This leads us to believe that a lot of bicycle accidents happen when
  people rent them because they are used improperly, they are not handled properly, or they are used carelessly because so many young people use them as a substitute for
  driving while intoxicated or as a way to spend time with friends, which can lead to accidents more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Estación del Arte </strong></p>

<p>Bicycle accidents are more common than they are in other areas of the city in the vicinity of Madrid's Estación del Arte, which is close to Atocha. There are a number of 
  causes for this, including excessive traffic, dangerous road conditions, and a lack of appropriate infrastructure for bicycles.</p>

<p>With a high concentration of both pedestrian and vehicular activity, the Estación del Arte is a lively neighbourhood. It is especially difficult for bicycles to manoeuvre
  safely due to the tight roads and poor visibility. Additionally, many drivers in this region have a bad habit of speeding, disobeying traffic regulations, and endangering 
  bicycles.</p> 

<p><strong>Cibeles</strong></p>

<p>Given that the Plaza de Cibeles is a popular tourist destination, it is not unexpected that there are more incidents there. It becomes more likely for this kind of 
  catastrophe to happen if we include the fact that it is one of the locations of BiciMad stations. Additionally, it should be mentioned that Plaza Cibeles is situated in 
  the midst of Calle de Alcalá, which also crosses, and Paseo de Recoletos, which is a popular promenade and one of the main thoroughfares that runs through the city.</p> 

<p><strong>Gran Vía with San Bernardo</strong></p>

<p>The nearby locations show that the region is a popular tourist and recreation destination. Gran Va is really one of Madrid's most well-known avenues and the one through
  which more visitors pass through each day. It is hardly surprise that streets as busy as Gran Vía see a significant portion of traffic incidents, not just involving 
  bicycles. Numerous entertainment venues, like the Harlequin Theatre of Gran Vía, the Morocco Hall, the Lope de Vega Theatre, and the Rialto Theatre, are located 
  specifically in the location where we are standing. As a result, we may infer that it is a location with a large concentration of people and high levels of leisure 
  activities, which may result in the abuse of this sort of vehicle.</p>

<p>Heatmaps that display the frequency and location of traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023 are shown in this slideshow. Each heatmap offers a visual depiction 
  of the data gathered on traffic incidents in the city, with various colours denoting the frequency of accidents in each place. The city centre and M-30 ring road are
  high-accident risk locations, according to the statistics, and other suburban districts are also experiencing a spike in accidents. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic
  and ensuing lockdowns and restrictions had a significant impact on traffic patterns and accident rates, with 2020 showing a noticeable reduction in accidents, even
  though it is not shown completely due to the fact that when the streets were open again, more people went outside at higher rates.</p>

<p>Upon a careful analysis, we can observe a clear pattern emerging in the ranking of the areas posing the greatest threat to cyclists. Topping the list is Madrid's bustling
  city centre, which witnesses the highest volume of daily activity, ranging from vibrant streets and recreational areas to bustling office districts. Following closely 
  behind is the Moncloa-Aravaca area, which is no surprise given its status as a bustling university hub, frequented by droves of young people on a daily basis. Bringing 
  up the rear is the esteemed Salamanca neighbourhood, adjacent to the city centre, where countless businesses, eateries, and entertainment venues are found, alongside the
  stunning Retiro Park. Given its proximity to this popular destination, it's no wonder that Salamanca has become a veritable hotspot for cycling accidents. Indeed, it's a 
  common sight to see locals pedalling through its streets en route to enjoy a leisurely day in the park. Our analysis of this important issue is not only informative, but 
  also empowering. As cyclists and advocates for road safety, we believe that knowledge is power, and that by understanding the challenges facing cyclists on Madrid's roads, 
  we can work towards creating a safer and more accessible environment for all. </p>

<p>In conclusion, our analysis and visualization of traffic accidents in Madrid by bike provides valuable insights into this important issue and highlights the need for 
  continued efforts to promote safe cycling in our community. We hope that this data-driven approach will inspire further dialogue and action, and ultimately contribute 
  to a safer and more sustainable future for our city since most accidents occur due to the bad infrastructure of the city for cyclist. </p>
