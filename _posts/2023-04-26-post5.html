<p>Madrid is a city that never sleeps, with busy streets always humming with traffic, buses, and people. However, accidents are inevitable when there are so many people and cars using
  the same area. However, have you ever paused to consider how various weather conditions can affect the security of these crowded streets? </p>

<p>We were curious to learn more as data scientists. To better understand the effect of weather on road safety, we have dived deep to discover how different weather conditions, such as 
  clear sky or heavy rain, influenced the quantity and severity of incidents.</p>

<p>So, grab a coffee and come along as we explore the connection between the weather and traffic accidents in the dynamic city of Madrid.</p>

<p>Let's begin with a fundamental summary of the facts. On the days of each accident, we gathered data on the many kinds of weather that prevailed, including clear skies, hail, snow, 
  heavy rain, light rain, cloudy sky, and unidentified circumstances. The findings of our plotting of the number of accidents that happened for each kind of weather condition were intriguing.</p>

<p>It would seem logical that the best weather for driving would be clear sky at first. After all, what could possible go wrong with superb visibility and dry roads? However, it turned out
  that the most accidents in our data set occurred on clear days. This may be as a result of the fact that Madrid has mostly clear days, in which case it seems reasonable that there would be 
  more accidents. On clear days, it is also conceivable that drivers let their guard down and assume nothing unpleasant will happen, which raises the risk of an accident.</p>

<p>On the next data visualization by year we discovered some intriguing trends as we moved on to more severe weather situations. For instance, snowfall is quite uncommon in Madrid, but when 
  it comes, it may significantly affect traffic safety. The city was affected by the big blizzard Filomena in 2020, which significantly increased the frequency of accidents involving snow. Even 
  if this year is not typical, it is an intriguing observation to take into account.</p>

<p>We also examined the impact of accidents according to weather, and some interesting patterns emerged. Surprisingly, few incidents required medical attention, which is a good indication. 
  However, incidents that happened on clear days were the most common reason for the need for medical attention. However, incidents that did require medical attention were typically those that 
  happened on clear days. We assume that this may be the case on clear days when drivers may pilot more carelessly due to a false sense of security.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that the most typical kind of medical aid was given on the scene of the collision emphasises the need of having well-trained first responders on hand to help individuals
  in need as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Overall, our investigation into how the weather has a role in traffic accidents in Madrid was instructive and educational. Although it may seem safer to travel under clear skies, it is vital to
  keep in mind that accidents may happen at any time, regardless of the weather. We can all do our share to make our roadways safe for everyone by being watchful and cautious.</p>
